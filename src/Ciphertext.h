This software is a computer program whose purpose is to provide to the 
research community a proof-of-concept implementation of the homomorphic 
evaluation of the lightweight block cipher SIMON, describe in the paper
"A Comparison of the Homomorphic Encryption Schemes FV and YASHE", of
Tancrede Lepoint and Michael Naehrig, available at
